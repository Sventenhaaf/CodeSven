TA Material:
- Keep text value in hidden box (is working but feels hacky)
- error handling in the stores - is this a good way?
- General security (before_action & auth token)

Todo now:
- add likes (model, controller, Jbuilder, view - like button and show total likes)
- add tags (model, controller, Jbuilder, view - Add tags during save, show tags in snippet show, search)

Nice to have:
- Indicate that snippet is saved properly
- Fix browse/create button name
- More CRUD functionality to snippets ( basically, apply fork button and add delete functionality)
- Nicer display of error messages
- Run code at cmd-Enter
- Smooth User login / snippet save form appear
- Put author name instead of author id
- Search options

Very Cool for Later:
- HTML and CSS
- Redo the interpreter - getting all errors to work etc
