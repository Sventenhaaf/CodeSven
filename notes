Keep in mind CodeMirror for code editing

Played around with prettify, might need to redo this:
- download prettify js and save locally in javascripts
- require in application.js
- download prettify css and save locally in styles
- require in application.css

Save Github:
echo "# CodeSven" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/Sventenhaaf/CodeSven.git
git push -u origin master
